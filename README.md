# ReplayManagerV1
Simple UI for viewing, deleting and launching all your replays in a centralized location!
Lets you launch replay files without going through the League client;
Allows users to view and watch replays past the top 20 in your clients match history (After that you're unable to find the play icon in the client)
Also means users can rename and organise their replays as they see fit!

## Planned updates 
-Adding "View button" rather than double clicking to launch
-Parsing .rofl files to show champion and user stats (Item builds, champion etc)
-Improving poor UI
